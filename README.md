# Butter Engine

Butter Engine is a game engine made in LWJGL and uses it's subset libraries for various tasks. What originally started out as a simple rendering library to make the use of LWJGL easier is now becoming a fully fledged engine and with the hope to fill the same role as Garry's Mod in end user development.

## TODO/Goals/What I'm working on:
  
### Rendering
   - [X] Rasterizing Shader Pipeline

   - [ ] Multi-Texture Suppport
   - [ ] Phong Lighting
   - [ ] PBR Lighting
   - [ ] Dynamic Lights
   - [ ] Baked Lightmaps
   
### ECS
   - [X] Implement Ashley
   - [X] Entity Creation
   - [X] Logic Creation
