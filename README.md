# Butter Engine

Butter Engine is a game engine made in LWJGL and uses it's subset libraries for various tasks. What originally started out as a simple rendering library to make the use of LWJGL easier is now becoming a fully fledged engine with easier end user development.

## TODO/Goals/What I'm working on:
  
### Rendering
   - [X] Rasterize Pipeline Shaders
   - [X] Mesh System
   - [ ] Model Loading
   - [ ] Make a dev tool for making Models with Animation data
   - [ ] Multi-Texture Support
   - [ ] Make a dev tool for making Materials
   - [ ] PBR & Phong Lighting
   - [ ] Dynamic Lights
   - [ ] Baked Lightmaps
   - [ ] Transparency

### UI
   - [ ] Integrate Legui
   - [ ] Make our own Hasbrown programming language for UI
   - [ ] Make a dev tool for making UI

### Physics
   - [X] Implement JBullet
   - [X] Math Compatibility
   - [ ] Physics Model Loading
   - [ ] Add Source Engine Movement

### Worlds
   - [X] Entity Creation
   - [X] Logic Creation
   - [ ] First Person Camera
   - [ ] Third Person Camera
   - [ ] World Loading
   - [ ] Hammer 
   - [ ] Make a dev tool for making Maps
  
### Audio
   - [ ] Spacial Audio
   - [ ] Any-Sound Playback
   - [ ] Volume Control
 
### Proper Modding Support
   - [ ] Documentation
   - [ ] Mod Loading/Unloading
   - [ ] Event Systems
  
### Networking
   - [ ] Implement Kyronet
   - [ ] Have a basis for Networking that supports what Butter Engine already does (i.e Do this last and have it do basic mod stuff)

### Adanced Features (way after first stable release)
   - [ ] Raytracing
   - [ ] Vulkan/DirectX Support
   - [ ] Steam Audio
