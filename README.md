# Butter Engine

Butter Engine is a game engine made in LWJGL and uses it's subset libraries for various tasks. What originally started out as a simple rendering library to make the use of LWJGL easier is now becoming a fully fledged engine and with the hope to fill the same role as Garry's Mod in end user development.

## What's left to do:
  
### Rendering
   - [ ] PBR/Multi-Texture Suppport
   - [ ] Model Loading
   - [ ] Lighting
   - [ ] Ray Traycing?
   
### Entity/Scene Management
   - [ ] Look into popular ECS implimentations
  
### Audio
   - [ ] Basic Spacial Audio
   - [ ] Audio Management
   - [ ] Look into Valve Spatial Audio
 
### Proper Modding Support
   - [ ] Tools
   - [ ] Documentation
   - [ ] Mod Loading/Unloading
   - [ ] Event Systems
  
### Networking (Maybe SteamWorks)
   - [ ] If not SteamWorks, KyroNet
   - [ ] Have a basis for Networking that supports what Butter Engine already does (i.e Do this last and have it do basic mod stuff)
